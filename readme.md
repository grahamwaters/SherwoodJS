### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd RobinHoodie
```
Install the required dependencies:

Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your Robinhood credentials:
```
ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your_username

# Usage
## Logging In
To use the library, you first need to log in to Robinhood. Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
const Auth = require('./src/auth/auth');

async function login() {
    const auth = new Auth();
    await auth.login();
}

login();
```
# Fetching Portfolio
Once logged in, you can fetch your portfolio details:

```javascript
Copy code
const Account = require('./src/account/account');

async function displayPortfolio() {
    const account = new Account();
    const portfolio = await account.getPortfolio();
    console.log(portfolio);
}

displayPortfolio();
```
# Making Trades
You can place orders for stocks or cryptocurrencies:

```javascript
Copy code
const Stocks = require('./src/stocks/stocks');
